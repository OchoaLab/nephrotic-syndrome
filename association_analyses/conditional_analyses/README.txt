GMMAT conditional analysis for chromosome 6 SNP

* Most significant SNP from each subanalysis is selected to be the 'conditional' SNP for the next round of conditional association test. (Conditional SNP is different for each subanalysis.) 

* Analysis performed one round for NS vs Control (+ 3 main ancestry groups subanalyses) and two rounds for SSNS vs Control (+ 3 main ancestry group subanalyses)

* Only SSNS vs Control and SSNS vs Control - African subanalysis is included in this folder

* The 'create' files creates new covar file that includes the genotypes of new top SNP to be conditioned on

* The 'plots' Rmd file creates stacked Manhattan plots of original, cond1, and cond2 GMMAT results. Also writes top 5000 SNPs into locus zoom format to be uploaded on the website for quick visualization of nearby genes.
